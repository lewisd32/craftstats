 
Craft merge:

Merge 2 craft files
Each craft file must have one decoupler with one side disconnected
 * one decoupler will be removed in the merge
Payload must be correctly rotated for merge.  No checking or changing will be done.
 * ie. decoupler must be facing up on launcher, down on payload.
All capsules will be retained.
 * if there is more than one, the primary capsule in launcher will continue to be primary capsule. 
Renumber UIDs in payload to ensure no overlap with launcher.
 * find highest UID in launcher, and renumber everything in payload to higher numbers.
 1. read launcher craft to find highest launcher UID
 2. read payload craft to generate mapping of old payload UID to new payload UID
 3. copy launcher craft file into new file, verbatim.
 4. stream payload craft file into new file, skipping header, and doing basically sed operation to replace payload UIDs using mapping
  * find decouplers
  * pick one decoupler to remove
  * calculate how to translate payload coordinates
  * translate coordinates
  * attach to decoupler
  * remove one decoupler
